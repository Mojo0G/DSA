          **Summary:** The code utilizes two arrays: the input `nums` array and an `ans` array to store the start and end indices of the target.  It employs a binary search algorithm (`search` function) twice: once to find the leftmost occurrence (firstindex = true) and again to find the rightmost occurrence (firstindex = false) of the target.  The `search` function iteratively narrows the search space until the target is found, adjusting the search bounds based on whether it's searching for the first or last occurrence.

          - Time Complexity: O(log n). The binary search algorithm is used, which has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the length of the input array. The algorithm performs binary search twice, but the overall time complexity remains O(log n).
          - Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. The space used by the `ans` array and the variables within the `search` function is constant.
